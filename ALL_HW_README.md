1.CC_save is mainly about using basic verilog code to solve some math calculating problem 

2.queen_save is about how to solve the 12-queens problem(advanced-8-queens)

3.SUBWAY_save is about implementing the player movement patterns in the popular game Subway Surfers.

4.NN_save is about Recurrent Neural Network,the calculation in this project is complicated,we need to use IEEE floating point to solve it.The concept of IP and pipeline are first used in this homework,since there are area limited,we have to use pipeline IP to finish it,or it will definetely fail due to area limited

5.MMT_save is the project that we need to learn how to use SRAM,so the homework is mainly about how we use sram to save data and read the data to do some calculation.

6.HW6 is similar to HW4,the different is that we need to write our own IP this time.

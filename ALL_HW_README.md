1.CC_save is mainly about using basic verilog code to solve some math calculating problem 

2.queen_save is about how to solve the 12-queens problem(advanced-8-queens)

3.SUBWAY_save is about implementing the player movement patterns in the popular game Subway Surfers.

4.NN_save is about Recurrent Neural Network,the calculation in this project is complicated,we need to use IEEE floating point to solve it.The concept of IP and pipeline are first used in this homework,since there are area limited,we have to use pipeline IP to finish it,or it will definetely fail due to area limited

5.MMT_save is the project that we need to learn how to use SRAM,so the homework is mainly about how we use sram to save data and read the data to do some calculation.

6.HW6 is similar to HW4,the different is that we need to write our own IP this time.

7.Midterm_GLCM_save is about how to use dram to solve GLCM problem,and it should follow AXI4 protocol

8.Midterm_test_TRIANGLE is our Midterm exam,we need to use IP to solve the problem(Since the exam questions must not be disclosed,I can only remember that it was about some complicated triangle problem) 

9.HW7_CDC is about clock domain crossing,it will give us two clock in one design,and we need to use some verilog logic to decide when should we use clock 1 and when should we use clock 2

10.HW8 is about how to use clock gating to reduce power consumption

11.HW9 is about system verilog,and we need to use concept of bridge to solve the problem , HW10 is the pattern of HW9.Because the TA made the assignment very complex and difficult, it was divided into two parts.

12.HW11 & HW12 are mainly about APR,so there's no coding that can be included.
